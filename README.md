Market is a service for buying and selling digital goods using the XRPL

WIP - this project is still in active development, and most core features have not been implemented yet

Publishers may post products to be sold for XRP or any issued currency
Users can then purchase access to these published products using the specified currency


Distributors host the products on their servers
Space on a distributor can be rented by a publisher, or they may setup their own distributors
